To use the application, simply go to the "dist" folder and open the "index.html" file.

This application maps out the silk road using modern routing. The silk road in this context means the terrestrial part 
of the network of ancient trade routes as depicted in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cities_along_the_Silk_Road. 
Ancient cities are replaced by their modern counterparts. The main routes of the silk road are marked on the map, 
but important cities are marked even if they aren't on the most important routes. The routes are adjusted to modern 
roads. There's also functionality to show hotels in each city. 

Clicking the "GET HOTELS"-button searches the area of each of the marked city for hotels. The search might take a bit 
of time because of the large amount of data. Clicking on marked points on the map displays their name, if available.

City locations are based on data from wikipedia.

The used map is OpenStreetMap, and hotel locations are queried from OpenStreetMap OverPass API 
(© OpenStreetMap contributors).
